the script simulates the noise environment under AWGN channel, and calculates BER under
different bit rate, SNR and threshhold

Set up running environment:
    1. Install Python3
    2. Install scipy library:
        sudo pip3 install scipy
    3. Install numpy library:
        sudo pip3 install numpy
How to run the script:
    1. execute run.py(approximately 1 - 5 minutes running time):
        python3 run.py
    2. plot output:
        gnuplot plot.gnu
